# Deploying Packaged Kubernetes Apps with Helm
Introduction
Helm is a powerful tool that can allow you to more easily manage applications in Kubernetes. This lab will give you a chance to get hands-on with Helm by installing Helm and deploying a Helm chart.

## Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:
```shell
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
```
Install Helm
Obtain and add the GPG key for the Helm repository:
```shell
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
Set up the repository:
```shell
echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
```
Update your local package listings:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
```
Install Helm:
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y helm
```
Verify the installation:
```shell
helm version
```
Install a Helm Chart in the Cluster
Add the bitnami chart repository:
```shell
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```
Update the chart listing:
```shell
helm repo update
```
Install the chart in the cert-manager Namespace:
```shell
helm install -n cert-manager cert-manager bitnami/cert-manager
```
View the Pods created by the Helm installation:
```shell
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
```
View the Deployments created by the Helm installation:
```shell
kubectl get deployments -n cert-manager
```
View the Services created by the Helm installation:
```shell
kubectl get svc -n cert-manager
```
